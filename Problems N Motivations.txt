   Motivation 01--> 
        The use of technology to conduct activities, processes, or sequences of actions without the need for constant human intervention is known as
        process automation. This might include everything from simple repeated operations to complicated workflows. 
        The aim is to eliminate human resources from routine and time-consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on more strategic and creative tasks.
        A number of benefits can be offered, which are listed below.
        Enhanced Efficiency 
        Achieving savings on costs
        Resources that are not being used can be scaled

  In HR, data inaccuracy refers to inaccuracies or inconsistencies in information pertaining to employees, employment positions, benefits, payroll, and 
  other HR-related problems. Here are a handful of instances and their consequences.Proof of HR Data Inaccuracy like,

  data flow between them.
